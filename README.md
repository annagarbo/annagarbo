## Hi there I’m Anna 👋 

I work at the interface between **statistical mechanics and data science**,  
using models to understand how **complex systems evolve and spread information**.

🎓 MSc in *Physics of Data* — University of Padua  
📍 Italy

### 🔬 Current focus

- modeling disease spreading processes on complex networks  
- stochastic and agent-based simulations  
- data-driven approaches to population and interaction dynamics
  

> I am interested in models that are **interpretable**,  
> not just accurate.

### 🌱 Research interests

- complex systems and networks  
- epidemic and information spreading  
- natural processes and pattern formation 
- biophysical modeling of living systems  
- data-driven modeling and inference
